# Raylib 2D ASCII RPG Project

## PURPOSE

Creating an RPG is no trivial game project, but it is definitely one of the most rewarding. It's a type
of project that you can explore and experiment with different ideas while you're creating something.

We're going to attempt to create a "classic" RPG type of game in a similar vein to Ultima III or Ultima
IV.

We'll be using Raylib and the C programming language.

## STORYLINE

No idea yet. Eventually when the game pieces feel solid, then perhaps we can crowd-source a storyline idea
with the help of YOU.

## GETTING STARTED

For following along with a particular video:
- Navigate to the `tags` list: https://github.com/erikyuzwa/raylib-2d-ascii-rpg-project/tags
- Choose the desired tag and download that

For the current state of the `main` branch:

- `git clone git@github.com:erikyuzwa/raylib-2d-ascii-rpg-project.git`
- Open the resulting `.sln` file with Visual Studio 2022 Community
- Build!

## ASSETS 

I am only using (and interested in using) royalty-free and open assets for this project.
Since I'm not too convinced I can make use of the actual Ultima III or Ultima IV tilesets that
have been "liberated" from the actual games themselves, I am keeping to a simple display
of ASCII characters. 

Any images, music and sound effects will have accompanying attribution when used.
